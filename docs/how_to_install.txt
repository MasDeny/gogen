# How to install

1. Obviously you need to install the golang in your system
make sure you can run golang by running
```shell
$ go
```

2. Git clone gogen from github to your local
```shell
$ git clone github.com/mirzaakhena/gogen
```

3. Install the gogen into your system by running

```shell
$ go install
```
It will compile, create a binary and install it into your system (you need setting path) then try this command to call it via terminal
```shell
$ gogen
```
If you see
```
Try one of this command to learn how to use it
  gogen service
  gogen gateway
  gogen controller
  gogen web
  gogen usecase
  gogen application
  gogen webapp
  gogen enum
  gogen repository
  gogen error
  gogen test
  gogen valuestring
  gogen valueobject
  gogen crud
  gogen openapi
  gogen domain
  gogen entity
```

Then gogen is ready to use

But if you see
```
zsh: command not found: gogen
```

Then you need to install it manually


If you got something like "command not found: gogen" Means that you are not setting the go path correctly.

Alternative way, You can also create a gogen executable with
```shell
$ go build
```
it will compile and create a executable file in under gogen directory
copy paste the builded executable file into your project. Then you can call
```shell
$ ./gogen
```

Create a binary for cross platform
Create for a windows
```shell
$ GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build
```

Create for a mac
```shell
$ GOOS=darwin  GOARCH=amd64 go build
```

If you create gogen executable manually, please remember to always to put the gogen executable into .gitignore so it will ignored in your git source code
```.gitignore
./gogen
```
